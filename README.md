# face-mask-detector

This project is a face mask detector which uses openCV to detect changes in face mask position and hence tells whether or not the face mask is present correctly on face.

The model has been trained to an accuracy of 99.27& and the dataset used is one by Prajna Bhandary and is really great. Please do check my project out.
